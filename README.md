# Airbnb_Analysis
**Project Overview**
This project aims to analyze Airbnb data to extract valuable insights for hosts and potential guests. By leveraging MySQL for data storage and using Python libraries for data cleaning, visualization, and presentation, we create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard. The comprehensive analysis includes price variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends.

**Domain**
Travel Industry, Property Management, and Tourism

**Problem Statement**
This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb data stored in a MySQL database and converted to CSV files. The objectives are to clean and prepare the dataset, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends. The final goal is to provide a comprehensive, interactive dashboard for users to explore and understand Airbnb market dynamics.

**Objectives**
**Data Acquisition**: Establish a connection to the MySQL database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset.
**Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types.
**Interactive Visualization**: Develop a Streamlit web application that utilizes geospatial data to create interactive maps.
**Price Analysis and Visualization**: Analyze and visualize price variations across different locations, property types, and seasons.
**Comprehensive Dashboard Creation**: Utilize Power BI to create a final dashboard integrating insights from various visualizations.
**Workflow**
Data Acquisition: Connect to the MySQL database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset.
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Clean the data using Pandas to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and transform data types.
Interactive Visualization with Streamlit: Develop a Streamlit web application to display interactive maps and user-selectable filters.
Price Analysis and Visualization: Analyze price variations and create visualizations using Plotly or Seaborn.
Comprehensive Dashboard Creation (Power BI): Combine various visualizations to create a comprehensive dashboard.
**Skills Takeaway**
Python Scripting: Develop proficiency in Python scripting for data analysis and visualization.
Data Preprocessing: Gain expertise in data cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming data types.
Visualization: Learn to create interactive visualizations using libraries like Plotly and Seaborn.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to uncover patterns and insights in the Airbnb dataset.
Streamlit: Build interactive web applications using Streamlit for data exploration.
MySQL: Utilize MySQL for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Power BI: Create comprehensive dashboards to present key insights from the analysis.
**Expected Outcome**
An interactive and informative dashboard providing valuable insights for both potential Airbnb hosts and guests. The dashboard should allow users to explore:

Listing availability and pricing trends in different locations
Comparison of prices based on property type, room type, and amenities
Insights into Geographical Distribution of Listings and seasonal variations
This project will empower users to make informed decisions when listing or booking Airbnb accommodations.

**Conclusion**
This project provides an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore Airbnb listings, pricing trends, and location-based insights. By leveraging MySQL and Python, the project enhances decision-making for Airbnb stakeholders through effective data analysis and visualization.
